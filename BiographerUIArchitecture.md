# Biographer UI architecture #

The architecture of the Biographer UI component was strongly influenced by the [GSoC 2011 idea](http://rumo.biologie.hu-berlin.de/gsoc/jslib.html) and [jQuery's architecture](https://github.com/jquery/jquery). The following image shows the architectural decisions that were made. As the image will be shown in a small version you should open the [PNG version](http://wiki.biographer.googlecode.com/hg/images/biographer-ui-architecture.png) directly or use the [PDF version](http://wiki.biographer.googlecode.com/hg/images/biographer-ui-architecture.pdf) which is a vector graphic.

The notation used throughout these diagrams is based on the _Viewpoints for Architectural Decisions_ paper by Uwe van Heesch, Paris Avgeriou and Rich Hilliard (not yet published).
