calling biographer-visualization from command line using node.js:

install node.js
install jsdom (node.js module; i.e. with npm install jsdom; need npm to be installed as well)

goto {biographer-visualization-repository}/src/node directory

link biographer-ui.js & visualization-svg.css (from target tree after building biographer-visusalization) 
to current directory.
put jquery-1.7.js in current directory (tested with version 1.7; update path in biographer-node.js if using different version)

call node.js:

node biographer-node.js input.json output.svg [layouter-binary]

layouter-binary is optionally and will perform layout if given.

that's it.
