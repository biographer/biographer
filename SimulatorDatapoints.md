# Datapoint Visualization / Timeseries #

A separate Time Series Tab shows the Time Series Graph from the beginning for a particular node. Multiple Series can also be displayed at once. There is no export functionality currently as the Rickshaw library does not support it.

## Plotting with Javascript ##

The Rickshaw library is used for plotting, it internally utilises the d3 library to draw the SVG Graph
