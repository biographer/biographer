<h1>Using Biographer</h1>
<h2>Creating SBGN visualisations</h2>
<h3>Manually</h3>
To create a SBGN visualization from scratch first select the SBGN language you want to use in the menu on the left. The options are 
<ul>
    <li>PD - Process Description</li>
    <li>ER - Entity Relation</li>
    <li>AF - Activity Flow</li>
</ul>
<h4>Creating Nodes</h4>
Click on one of the different node types in the left menu and click onto the canvas to create the node at that position. A modal window will appear where you can enter the node label and change other node properties. 
<h4>Creating Edges</h4>
You can draw Edges by using the edge tool <div id="Edge" class="tool"></div> or the spline tool <div id="Spline" class="tool"></div>. Click on the tool and then click on two nodes you want to connect with an edge. Once two nodes are clicked a nodal popup will appear where you can choose the edge type. 
<h4>Deleting Nodes</h4>
To delete nodes select the nodes and press <div class="keyboard">Del</div> on your keyboard <br>or use the delete tool <div class="tool" id="del"></div>
<h3>Importing</h3>
Biographer can import SBGN graphs (with and without layout) from different sources. Use the import icon <div class="tool" id="import_file"></div> to open up the import modal popup. There you can either upload your personal docuemtns in one of the following formats:
<ul>
    <li><b>jSBGN</b><br>
        is Biographers native format. Is can contain only topological information or may also include proper layout information for all glyps in the graph.
    </li>
    <li><b>SBGN-ML</b><br>
        always contains layout information, though they may be set to arbitrary values that do not reflect a proper layout.
    </li>
    <li><b>SBML</b><br>
        only contains topological information, therefore you are required to layout the graph after importing it.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Layout</h2>
To help you laying our your SBGN graphs Biographer currenly provides tree automatic layout algorightms.
<ul>
    <li><div class="tool" id="layout_biographer"></div> biographer.flow <br>
        Respects compartments
    </li>
    <li><div class="tool" id="layout_grid"></div> biographer.grid <br>
        Respects compartments (but the compartments have to be layed out manually)<br>
        If you click once only one iteration of optimization for each nodes its executed. For better results apply this layout multiple times. Once the layout is stuck in a local minmum you can manually move some nodes and apply the layout again. You will see that this greatly improves the layout. <br>
        Holding down the <div class="keyboard">ctrl</div> key while clicking the grid layout button will only place each node on the cosest empty grid space. This can be used to quickly create great looking layouts manually.
    </li>
    <li><div class="tool" id="layout_force"></div> D3 force directed layout <br>
        Compartments are not supported <br>
        Uses the fantastic <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3 library</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Align and Distribute</h3>
The Align functions always align to the <b>first selected node</b>.
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<h3>Zooming</h3>
Since <div class="keyboard">ctrl + scroll</div> is already taken by the default zoom function in many browsers (like FireFox and Opera) biographer uses <div class="keyboard">alt + scroll</div> for zooming. <br>
If you are using a touch enable device you can use the <b>pinch gesture</b> (move two fingers towards each other or away from each other) to zoom.<br>
You can also zoom by using the zoom buttons. <br>
<img src="{{=URL(request.application, 'static/biographer-editor/img', 'zoom_in.png')}}"/> to zoom in <br>
<img src="{{=URL(request.application, 'static/biographer-editor/img', 'zoom_out.png')}}"/> to zoom out <br>
<img src="{{=URL(request.application, 'static/biographer-editor/img', 'one.png')}}"/> to get the original size
<h3>Panning</h3>
<div id="move" class="tool"></div> this tool can be used to pan the canvas - to move the whole canvas.
<h2>Exporting</h2>
<img src="{{=URL(request.application, 'static/biographer-editor/img', 'export.png')}}"/> Exporting images is supported for several document formats:
<ul>
    <li><b>jSBGN</b><br>
Biographers native exchange format is jSBGN (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/biographer/wiki/graph_exchange">described here</a>). This format ideal for transmission in the web and does only require topological information. 
    </li>
    <li><b>SVG</b><br>
Biographer natively renders the images in you browser in the SVG format. To export the SVG image click on
    </li>
    <li><b>other formats</b><br>
        With the help of an external Java based library biographer is also able to export to 
        <ul>
              <li>png</li>
              <li>pdf</li>
              <li>tiff</li>
          </ul>  
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Converting Document Formats</h3>
Go <a href="{{=URL('convert')}}">here</a> to convert between jSBGN, SBGN-ML and SBML using the <a href="https://github.com/chemhack/libSBGN.js">libSBGN.js library</a>. This is still under development and might not return what you expect.
<h1>SBGN Support</h1>
Biographer currently does not support the full SBGN specification. Missing glyphs include:
<ul>
    <li>Multimeres</li>
    <li>Submap</li>
    <li>3 way interaction circle ... todo look up the correct glyph name</li>
    <li>Notes</li>
</ul>
Also missing are clone markers and node ports (the little ends on e.g. process nodes).
<h1>System Requirements</h1>
Biographer currently works best with Chromium (Chrome), Opera and FireFox. Internet Explorer and Safari are not actively tested (Please do not use these browsers with biographer).
