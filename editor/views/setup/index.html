<h1>Setup</h1>

<h2>First User</h2>
This application features authorized file access, for this you will need to setup a user. 
<br />
If you use this application as a desktop application you will automatically be logged in 
<br />
(as the first user - if you access it directly from you computer and you will not have to remember your password :D)
{{=form}}
<h2>SMTP</h2>
Set this for outgoing email notifications. 
<br />
This is optional, and you will most likely not need this.
{{=LOAD('setup', 'setup_smtp', ajax=True)}}
