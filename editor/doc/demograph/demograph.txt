nodes:
 entity pool nodes (EPNs):
   0. sucrose
   1. h2o
   2. glucose
   3. fructose
   4. sucrase
 container nodes (CNs):
   5. compartment: cytoplasma (contains all other nodes)
 process nodes (PNs):
   6. reaction

reactions:
 h2o + sucrose -> glucose + fructose (catalyzed by sucrase)

edges:
 7. sucrose		-> reaction node
 8. h2o			-> reaction node
 9. reaction node	-> glucose
10. reaction node	-> fructose
11. sucrase		-> reaction node (catalyze)
